                  Sue Spence writes: &quot;This year's UK reunion is the largest 
                  ever, and as at 19 August, 219 bookings have been made for dinner 
                  on Saturday evening and 146 for the Curry lunch on Sunday. The 
                  other events are popular too, with over 100 expected at the 
                  Famous Royal Naval Volunteer pub on the Friday evening ice-breaker. 
                  The tour of Harvey's Wine Cellars on Saturday morning has attracted 
                  53 so far and 106 are going on the afternoon boat trip. There 
                  is still plenty of room on all these events for anyone who would 
                  like to join us. Unfortunately, the golf has had to be scrapped 
                  because of the inability to find a course which would host a 
                  party of guests on a Saturday afternoon. Those who have booked 
                  accommodation at the Marriott will be pleased to hear that after 
                  complicated negotiations the room rate has been reduced from 
                  �85 to �78. This is the rate that should appear on the reservation 
                  card which you're given when you check in at reception.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#3333FF">

                  CITY of Bristol has been chosen for the seventh BI Reunion. 
                  Having visited the north in 2000 the organisers thought a move 
                  to the west country would offer a convenient venue to those 
                  living in that part of the world. They also had in mind Bristol's 
                  excellent road, air and rail links; London and Birmingham are 
                  about an hour away by train. Bristol has all the usual facilities 
                  of a major city. The harbourside area is delightful and a major 
                  attraction is Brunel's <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="000099">ss 
                  Great Britain</font></b> and the Maritime Heritage Centre. If 
                  you visit the ship you may find the BISN Co plaque acknowledging 
                  the 1996 reunion's contribution to the replacement of its weather 
                  deck.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main 
                  events are to be held at the Bristol <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000099">Marriott 
                  Hotel</font></b> which is very conveniently situated in the 
                  city centre and is an ideal venue for us. Those at York will 
                  know we encountered a few problems with the hotel there. Happily, 
                  these are not likely be repeated in 2002 and we promise not 
                  to relegate the <font color="#000099"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chindwara/Chantala</font></b></font> 
                  cadets to the lobby! The Marriott has excellent facilities and 
                  should be large enough to accommodate comfortably the growing 
                  numbers who are discovering the existence of the BI worldwide 
                  network. It has good sized function rooms, with plenty of foyer 
                  space for notice boards, displays of memorabilia and so forth, 
                  so that any <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000099"><b>special 
                  interest groups</b></font> can set up their stalls and arrange 
                  their own gatherings. <img src="images%20bristol/marfront.jpg" width="179" height="131" align="right">There 
                  is an ample bar and lounge area (which is likely to be very 
                  popular as a social centre throughout the weekend) together 
                  with a coffee shop, spacious bedrooms, a swimming pool, and 
                  convenient parking for guests in the NCP right next door. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In York 
                  in 2000, for the first time, events were spread over a weekend: 
                  an organised boat trip on Saturday afternoon and traditional 
                  BI curry lunch on Sunday. All proved to be very popular and 
                  everyone seemed to appreciate the extra time available to spend 
                  with old friends. We�re organising a wider range of events in 
                  2002, including an informal 'ice breaker' at the Famous Royal 
                  Navy Volunteer pub. Also, if there is sufficient interest, we 
                  plan a visit to Harvey's of Bristol's wine cellars and a boat 
                  trip. In addition, Alan Myers has kindly offered to organise 
                  a golf tournament. All these are detailed on the <a href="bristoldetails.htm">events 
                  page</a>.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are

                  booking form (whether or not you intend to stay at the Marriott) 
                  and return it to me with your deposit of �25.00 (which includes 
                  the &pound;7 booking fee) per person as soon as possible. The 
                  final date for payment of the balances will be 31 August 2002 
                  after which I cannot guarantee to be able to make any refunds 
                  because the hotel requires payment in advance. I will send out 
                  reminders in June 2002. </font></p>
